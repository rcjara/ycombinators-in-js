# ycombinators-in-js
Some javascript code aimed to build up an understanding of y combinators.  These were used as slides during a presentation given at the [recurse center] (www.recurse.com).  The slide probably won't make sense without the accompanying talk, but here they are all the same.

The preferred reading order is as follows:
1. loop.js
1. basic_recursion.js
1. building_to_anon_recursion.js (non-working code)
1. anon_recursion.js
1. more_anon_recursion.js
1. currying.js
1. special_curry.js
1. ycom.js
1. special_y.js
